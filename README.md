# Yes Another Chess

Yes Another Chess is a chess engine written in Rust. Despite its name, this chess engine offers unique features and enhancements over previous versions. This chess engine emphasizes type safety, ensuring that moves are generated and validated with stricter type constraints. However, this approach currently makes the engine about **4x slower** than a previous [engine](https://github.com/DestinEcarma/chess-rust) I developed. Future optimizations may involve balancing type safety with performance by allowing some raw value indexing.
